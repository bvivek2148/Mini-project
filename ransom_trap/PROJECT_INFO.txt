Ransom-Trap: Dual-Layer Anti-Ransomware System (Entropy Guard + Decepti-File)\n\nOverview\n--------\nRansom-Trap is a proof-of-concept, cross-platform endpoint protection system written in Python.\nIt combines:\n\n1. Entropy Guard (active defense) - detects ransomware-like encryption by monitoring file\n   changes and computing Shannon entropy.\n2. Decepti-File (passive defense) - plants honeytoken files that trigger alerts when accessed.\n\nComponents\n----------\n1. Agent (runs on endpoint)\n   - Monitors configured folders for file creation/modification.\n   - Computes entropy for modified files and tracks per-process behavior.\n   - Detects suspicious activity based on thresholds (entropy, file count, time window).\n   - Plants honeytoken files and treats any access to them as a high-priority alert.\n   - Sends alerts to a central HTTP alert server and optionally terminates suspicious processes.\n\n2. Alert Server (central HTTP service)\n   - Receives alerts from one or more agents via POST /alerts.\n   - Stores alerts in memory and appends them to data/alerts.jsonl.\n   - Exposes:\n       - GET /alerts  -> alerts as JSON.\n       - GET /        -> simple HTML table listing alerts.\n\n3. Ransomware Simulator (for demo)\n   - Walks a target directory and overwrites each file with XOR-scrambled bytes.\n   - Used to generate high-entropy writes that should trigger Entropy Guard and,\n     if honeytokens are present, Decepti-File alerts.\n\nDirectory Layout\n----------------\nransom_trap/\n  agent/\n    __init__.py\n    agent_main.py\n    config_loader.py\n    detector.py\n    entropy.py\n    filesystem_watcher.py\n    honeytokens.py\n    process_tracker.py\n    response.py\n  server/\n    __init__.py\n    server_main.py\n    storage.py\n  simulator/\n    __init__.py\n    fake_ransomware.py\n  config/\n    config.example.windows.yaml\n    config.example.linux.yaml\n  data/\n    alerts.jsonl (created at runtime)\n  logs/\n    agent.log (created at runtime)\n  requirements.txt\n  PROJECT_INFO.txt (this file)\n\nDependencies\n------------\nPython 3.10+ and the following packages (see requirements.txt):\n  - watchdog\n  - psutil\n  - requests\n  - PyYAML\n  - fastapi\n  - uvicorn\n\nBasic Setup (Both Windows and Linux)\n------------------------------------\n1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:\n\n   cd ransom_trap\n   python -m venv venv\n   # On Linux/macOS:\n   source venv/bin/activate\n   # On Windows (PowerShell):\n   .\\venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n2. Copy and edit configuration:\n   - For Windows:\n       Copy config\\config.example.windows.yaml to config\\config.yaml\n       Edit monitored_paths, honeytoken_paths, and log_file.\n   - For Linux:\n       Copy config/config.example.linux.yaml to config/config.yaml\n       Edit monitored_paths, honeytoken_paths, and log_file.\n\n3. Start the alert server:\n\n   uvicorn server.server_main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000\n\n4. Start the agent (in another terminal):\n\n   python -m agent.agent_main --config config/config.yaml\n\n5. Run the ransomware simulator against a TEST directory that is included in\n   monitored_paths and honeytoken_paths:\n\n   python -m simulator.fake_ransomware /path/to/test/directory\n\n6. View alerts:\n   - Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in a browser to see alerts in HTML.\n   - Or GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/alerts to see raw JSON.\n\nNotes\n-----\n- This project is a proof-of-concept only. It is not hardened or suitable for\n  production use.\n- The process resolution logic is heuristic and may not always attribute file\n  activity to the exact process.\n- Use kill_on_detection=false during development to avoid terminating\n  legitimate processes by mistake.\n
